Things to improve in the Atbash cipher program:


- Keep numbers the same
- Ignore non-alphanumerical characters like , . ! and so on
- Ignore whitespaces

- The result of string.length() is a long unsigned int and apparently shouldn't be compared with just an int type

- Is it possible to specify which function you want to use after compiling the program? 
For example encode this, decode that...
